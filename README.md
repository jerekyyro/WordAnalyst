# WordAnalyst
An application that reads textfiles, counts frequencies of words and gives a list of the words, frequencies and percentage in descending order.

future stuff: 
    // re-organizing the list
    // tabs between words, N's and %'s
    // number of tokens and words
    // coping with just one list? --> use the methods of Word?
    // better to do with HashMap?
    // function for identifying inflected forms of same word
    // ---- if nnn contains n --> "are these different forms of a same word?"
    // ---- save different forms to same Word
    // - graphic interface: opening a file and some following functionalities:
    // - make a function for listing words that are in 
    // A) same paragraph and 
    // B) same sentence
    // ---- maybe by creating a temporary Objects Sentence and Paragraph that return the other words to a word 
    // ---- maybe as a continuous +++string?
    // ---- or maybe just a function to read the words in sent.'s and paragr.'s including a _selected word!_
    // - some kind of functionality to save the CAPITAL Letter tokens of a word
    // - comparison with word lists?
    // - downloading data from web resource?
